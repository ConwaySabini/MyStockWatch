About:

  MyStockWatch is a full-stack web app where you can create an account, add and remove stocks, 
  analyze stocks with different time frames and using various technical analysis indicators, 
  keep a list of favorites, create custom lists, check financial news and stock specific news, and more. 
  This application was deployed to Netlify and Heroku, with the front-end on Netlify, and the back-end on Heroku. 
  I used financial and news APIs to fetch the relevant data for the application and Auth0 for user authorization. 
  I Designed the front end with Bulma, component based architecture, and react hooks. 
  The server and API was implemented with NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB for storing the users, stock data, etc.
